Agendaris
=========

A web-based application to monitor the incoming and outgoing mail letter and distribute the mail to respective divisions. 
It is using at a local university in my hometown. I used PHP, MySql, jQuery, jqGrid (for displaying data and CRUD) and Ajax to develop this software. 
I used iReport for reporting service.
